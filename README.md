### Hello, my name is Andrew. üëã

I started programming when I was 13 and never looked back. I simply fell in love with the process of building things and helping people by using code. In 2020, I started Rusty Nail Software with the commitment of providing efficient development services in order to help companies build innovative software solutions for iOS. This company serves my long-term mission of providing resources for bee repopulation and stabilization.

I primarily work with iOS and utilize the following tools in development:
- Swift
- Xcode
- Cocoa Touch
- UIKit
- Core Graphics
- Core Location
- MapKit
- Google Firebase
- AWS Amplify
- SQL & MySQL
- JSON
- MVC

You can view my products on the App Store:
- [RoadHazard](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roadhazard/id1481914964)
RoadHazard is a pothole reporting system for iOS that aims to expedite the process of pothole report and repair time. To create this system, I used Swift, Core Location, MapKit and Google Firebase.
